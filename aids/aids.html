          <h2>What Is HIV</h2>
          <p>
            HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells
            that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable
            to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with
            certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during
            unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or
            treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure
            exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life. Luckily,
            however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called
            antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed,
            HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called
            the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral
            suppression. If a person’s viral load is so low that a standard lab
            can’t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load.
            People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep
            an undetectable viral load can live long and healthy lives and will
            not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.

          <h2>What Is AIDS</h2>
          <p>
            HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
            syndrome). AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when
            the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3
            years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life
            expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can
            still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be
            lifesaving. But people who start HIV medicine soon after they get
            HIV experience more benefits—that's why HIV testing is so important.
